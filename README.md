**StressOFF** is a smart mobile application designed to enhance well-being and stress management by combining:

AI-powered meal analysis (Qwen Vision + text models)

Real-time physiological monitoring via smartwatch

Calendar integration for context-aware recommendations

Its purpose is to help users balance their diet, improve recovery, and prevent stress or fatigue peaks through proactive and intelligent assistance.

**🚀 Key Features**
**1. Smart Meal Analysis**

Users capture a photo of their meal and select the type: breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack.

The AI detects ingredients, estimates nutritional values, and provides personalized recommendations.

Two analysis modes:

Meal Analysis – saves the meal to Firebase for daily tracking

Try Analysis – instant estimation without saving

**2. Daily Summary & Recommendations**

End-of-day analysis summarizing nutritional balance, total calorie intake, and tailored guidance for the following day.

**3. Continuous Physiological Monitoring**

Tracks heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), SpO₂, calories burned, active minutes, and sleep duration/quality.

Sends immediate alerts when anomalies are detected, along with actionable advice.

**4. Calendar Integration**

Syncs with the device’s calendar to adapt recommendations based on daily workload:

Busy day → energizing meals, recovery breaks

Light day → lighter meals, hydration reminders

**5. AI Coach Chatbot**

Natural conversational assistant providing:

Health guidance

Anti-stress exercises

Personalized motivation

Uses nutritional, physiological, and calendar data to deliver fully context-aware coaching.
