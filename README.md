### ❤️ Real-Time Health Monitoring  
When paired with a smartwatch, StressOFF tracks key physiological metrics:  
- Heart Rate (HR)  
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)  
- Blood Oxygen Level (SpO₂)  
- Active minutes & burned calories  
- Sleep duration and quality  

The system sends **instant alerts** when anomalies appear, along with actionable advice.
